# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Database Models with SQLAlchemy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities in the system based on the data models specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create base model class with common attributes
2. Implement Requirement model with specified fields
3. Implement TestSpecification and TestStep models
4. Implement Parameter, ParameterCategory, and ParameterVariant models
5. Implement GenericCommand and CommandCategory models
6. Set up relationships between models (foreign keys, etc.)
7. Implement model validation methods
8. Create initial Alembic migration script

Technology recommendations:
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support
- SQLAlchemy relationship definitions for model associations
- Alembic for migration management
- SQLAlchemy Declarative Base for model definitions
- Use SQLAlchemy hybrid properties for computed fields

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each model to verify field constraints and relationships. Test model validation methods. Verify that migrations can be applied and rolled back. Test model serialization and deserialization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Model and Core Entity Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the base model class with common attributes and core entity models including Requirement and TestSpecification models.
### Details:
1. Create a SQLAlchemy declarative base class with common attributes (id, created_at, updated_at)
2. Implement the Requirement model with all fields from PRD
3. Implement TestSpecification and TestStep models
4. Set up proper type annotations for all model fields
5. Implement basic model validation methods

## 2. Implement Parameter and Command Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the Parameter, ParameterCategory, ParameterVariant, GenericCommand, and CommandCategory models with proper relationships.
### Details:
1. Implement Parameter and ParameterCategory models
2. Create ParameterVariant model with relationships to Parameter
3. Implement GenericCommand and CommandCategory models
4. Set up proper relationships between models using foreign keys
5. Implement model-specific validation methods

## 3. Set Up Model Relationships and Associations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Establish all relationships between models including many-to-many, one-to-many, and one-to-one relationships.
### Details:
1. Set up relationship between Requirements and TestSpecifications
2. Implement associations between TestSpecifications and TestSteps
3. Create relationships between Parameters and their Variants
4. Set up Command and Category relationships
5. Implement any additional cross-model relationships specified in the PRD
6. Configure cascade behavior for all relationships

## 4. Implement Advanced Model Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Add advanced SQLAlchemy features including hybrid properties, custom validators, and serialization methods.
### Details:
1. Implement SQLAlchemy hybrid properties for computed fields
2. Create custom validators using SQLAlchemy validation hooks
3. Add serialization/deserialization methods for all models
4. Implement custom query methods on models
5. Add indexing for performance optimization

## 5. Create Alembic Migration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Set up Alembic for database migrations and create the initial migration script for all models.
### Details:
1. Initialize Alembic migration environment
2. Configure Alembic to work with SQLAlchemy async
3. Create initial migration script for all models
4. Test migration apply and rollback functionality
5. Document migration process for development team
