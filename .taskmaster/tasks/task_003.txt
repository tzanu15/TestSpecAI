# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Database Models with SQLAlchemy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SQLAlchemy models for all entities in the system based on the data models specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create base model class with common attributes
2. Implement Requirement model with specified fields
3. Implement TestSpecification and TestStep models
4. Implement Parameter, ParameterCategory, and ParameterVariant models
5. Implement GenericCommand and CommandCategory models
6. Set up relationships between models (foreign keys, etc.)
7. Implement model validation methods
8. Create initial Alembic migration script

Technology recommendations:
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support
- SQLAlchemy relationship definitions for model associations
- Alembic for migration management
- SQLAlchemy Declarative Base for model definitions
- Use SQLAlchemy hybrid properties for computed fields

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each model to verify field constraints and relationships. Test model validation methods. Verify that migrations can be applied and rolled back. Test model serialization and deserialization.
