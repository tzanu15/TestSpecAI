# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure for both frontend and backend components, and set up the development environment.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository for the project
2. Set up the backend directory structure as specified in the PRD
3. Set up the frontend directory structure as specified in the PRD
4. Configure VS Code with recommended extensions for Python, React, and TypeScript
5. Create .gitignore files for both frontend and backend
6. Set up Python virtual environment for backend development
7. Initialize Node.js project for frontend development
8. Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions

Technology recommendations:
- Git for version control
- Python 3.11+ for backend
- Node.js 18+ for frontend
- VS Code with Python, React, and TypeScript extensions

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository structure matches the PRD specifications. Ensure all development environment components can be initialized without errors. Test that the README provides clear setup instructions that new developers can follow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and set up the basic project structure for both frontend and backend components.
### Details:
Create a new Git repository on GitHub/GitLab. Clone the repository locally. Create the basic directory structure including separate folders for frontend and backend. Add initial README.md with project overview. Create .gitignore files for both frontend and backend components.

## 2. Set Up Backend Development Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the Python environment and install necessary dependencies for backend development.
### Details:
Create a Python virtual environment using venv or conda. Install Python 3.11+. Set up requirements.txt with initial dependencies including FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, and Alembic. Configure VS Code with Python extensions and settings. Create initial backend structure with main.py and necessary directories.

## 3. Set Up Frontend Development Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Node.js project and install necessary dependencies for frontend development.
### Details:
Install Node.js 18+ and npm. Initialize a new React project using a tool like Vite or Create React App with TypeScript support. Install initial dependencies including React, TypeScript, and development tools. Configure VS Code with React and TypeScript extensions. Set up initial project structure according to PRD specifications.

## 4. Configure Development Tools and Linting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up code quality tools, linting, and formatting configurations for both frontend and backend.
### Details:
For backend: Configure Black, isort, flake8, and mypy for Python code formatting and linting. For frontend: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configuration. Create editor configuration files (.editorconfig) for consistent formatting. Set up pre-commit hooks for automated linting and formatting checks.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop detailed documentation for the project setup, development workflow, and contribution guidelines.
### Details:
Expand the README.md with detailed setup instructions for both frontend and backend. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for code style, pull requests, and development workflow. Document the project structure and architecture. Create a development environment setup guide with step-by-step instructions for new developers.
