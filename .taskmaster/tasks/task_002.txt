# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Backend Framework and Database Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the FastAPI framework with necessary configurations and establish database connections for both development and production environments.
# Details:
1. Install FastAPI and required dependencies (pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, alembic, etc.)
2. Create main.py with FastAPI app initialization
3. Set up configuration management with environment variables
4. Configure SQLite database connection for development
5. Configure PostgreSQL database connection for production
6. Set up SQLAlchemy async engine and session management
7. Configure Alembic for database migrations
8. Implement database connection pooling

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI 0.100.0+
- Pydantic v2.0+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- Alembic for migrations
- python-dotenv for environment variable management
- SQLite for development
- asyncpg for PostgreSQL async support

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify database connections can be established. Test configuration loading from environment variables. Verify that Alembic migrations can be created and applied. Test connection pooling under load.
