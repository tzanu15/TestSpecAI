# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Backend Framework and Database Connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the FastAPI framework with necessary configurations and establish database connections for both development and production environments.
# Details:
1. Install FastAPI and required dependencies (pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, alembic, etc.)
2. Create main.py with FastAPI app initialization
3. Set up configuration management with environment variables
4. Configure SQLite database connection for development
5. Configure PostgreSQL database connection for production
6. Set up SQLAlchemy async engine and session management
7. Configure Alembic for database migrations
8. Implement database connection pooling

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI 0.100.0+
- Pydantic v2.0+
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+
- Alembic for migrations
- python-dotenv for environment variable management
- SQLite for development
- asyncpg for PostgreSQL async support

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify database connections can be established. Test configuration loading from environment variables. Verify that Alembic migrations can be created and applied. Test connection pooling under load.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install FastAPI and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project environment by installing FastAPI and all required dependencies for the backend framework.
### Details:
Install FastAPI 0.100.0+, Pydantic v2.0+, SQLAlchemy 2.0+, Alembic, python-dotenv, and asyncpg. Create a requirements.txt file to document all dependencies with specific versions. Set up a virtual environment for development isolation. Configure pip-tools for dependency management if needed.

## 2. Create FastAPI Application Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Establish the core application structure with main.py and configuration management using environment variables.
### Details:
Create main.py with FastAPI app initialization. Implement configuration management with python-dotenv for environment variables. Set up a config.py module to centralize configuration access. Create a .env file template with required variables. Implement configuration for different environments (dev, test, prod).

## 3. Configure Development Database Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Set up SQLite database connection for the development environment with SQLAlchemy.
### Details:
Configure SQLite database connection for development. Implement SQLAlchemy async engine setup for SQLite. Create database initialization functions. Set up connection pooling parameters appropriate for development. Implement database health check functionality.

## 4. Configure Production Database Connection [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement PostgreSQL database connection for production with asyncpg and connection pooling.
### Details:
Configure PostgreSQL database connection using asyncpg. Implement production-ready connection pooling settings. Set up SQLAlchemy async engine for PostgreSQL. Create database URL construction from environment variables. Implement connection retry logic and timeout handling.

## 5. Set Up Database Migrations with Alembic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Configure Alembic for database schema migrations and version control.
### Details:
Initialize Alembic for the project. Configure Alembic to work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Set up migration script templates. Create initial migration script. Implement migration commands in project CLI. Configure automatic migration detection based on model changes.
