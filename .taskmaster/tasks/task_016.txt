# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Test Specification Editor UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface for creating and editing test specifications, including test steps and parameter selection.
# Details:
1. Create TestSpecList component with filtering and pagination
2. Implement TestSpecEditor for creating and editing test specifications
3. Create TestStepBuilder with drag-and-drop functionality
4. Implement GenericCommandSelector for selecting commands
5. Create RequirementSelector for linking requirements
6. Implement parameter selection and validation
7. Create TestDataDescription generator
8. Implement test step sequence management

Technology recommendations:
- Ant Design Table for test specification list
- Ant Design Form for test specification form
- React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop
- Ant Design Select with custom rendering for command selection
- Implement form validation with React Hook Form and Zod
- Use Ant Design Steps for test step sequence visualization
- Implement auto-save functionality for test specifications
- Use Monaco Editor for advanced command editing

# Test Strategy:
Test test specification list with various filter combinations. Verify that the test specification editor validates input correctly. Test drag-and-drop functionality for test steps. Verify that command selection works correctly. Test parameter validation and TestDataDescription generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create TestSpecList Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a component for displaying test specifications with filtering and pagination capabilities
### Details:
Implement a TestSpecList component using Ant Design Table that includes: 1) Searchable and filterable columns for test specification attributes, 2) Pagination with configurable page size, 3) Sorting functionality for relevant columns, 4) Quick actions for editing, duplicating, and deleting test specifications, 5) Status indicators for test specifications

## 2. Implement TestSpecEditor Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a form-based editor for creating and editing test specifications with validation
### Details:
Develop the TestSpecEditor using Ant Design Form and React Hook Form with Zod validation that includes: 1) Fields for test specification metadata (name, description, etc.), 2) Auto-save functionality, 3) Form validation with error messages, 4) Submission handling with loading states, 5) Integration with the backend API for saving specifications

## 3. Develop TestStepBuilder with Drag-and-Drop [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create a component for building test steps with drag-and-drop reordering capabilities
### Details:
Implement TestStepBuilder using react-beautiful-dnd that allows: 1) Adding new test steps from a command palette, 2) Reordering steps via drag-and-drop, 3) Editing individual step properties, 4) Deleting steps, 5) Visualizing the step sequence using Ant Design Steps component

## 4. Create Command and Parameter Selection Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Implement components for selecting commands and configuring their parameters
### Details:
Develop GenericCommandSelector and ParameterSelector components that: 1) Use Ant Design Select with custom rendering for command selection, 2) Dynamically load available parameters based on selected command, 3) Support parameter validation based on type and constraints, 4) Provide appropriate input controls for different parameter types, 5) Include Monaco Editor integration for advanced command editing

## 5. Implement Requirement Linking and Test Data Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.4
### Description: Create components for linking requirements and generating test data descriptions
### Details:
Develop RequirementSelector and TestDataDescription components that: 1) Allow searching and selecting requirements to link to test specifications, 2) Display requirement coverage information, 3) Generate appropriate test data descriptions based on parameters, 4) Validate test data against requirements, 5) Provide visual feedback on requirement coverage
