# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Test Specification Editor UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface for creating and editing test specifications, including test steps and parameter selection.
# Details:
1. Create TestSpecList component with filtering and pagination
2. Implement TestSpecEditor for creating and editing test specifications
3. Create TestStepBuilder with drag-and-drop functionality
4. Implement GenericCommandSelector for selecting commands
5. Create RequirementSelector for linking requirements
6. Implement parameter selection and validation
7. Create TestDataDescription generator
8. Implement test step sequence management

Technology recommendations:
- Ant Design Table for test specification list
- Ant Design Form for test specification form
- React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop
- Ant Design Select with custom rendering for command selection
- Implement form validation with React Hook Form and Zod
- Use Ant Design Steps for test step sequence visualization
- Implement auto-save functionality for test specifications
- Use Monaco Editor for advanced command editing

# Test Strategy:
Test test specification list with various filter combinations. Verify that the test specification editor validates input correctly. Test drag-and-drop functionality for test steps. Verify that command selection works correctly. Test parameter validation and TestDataDescription generation.
