# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Advanced UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop specialized UI components for the application's unique requirements.
# Details:
1. Create ConfidenceScore component for visualizing match confidence
2. Implement ProgressIndicator for AI processing status
3. Create DataTable with advanced filtering and sorting
4. Implement CoverageVisualization for requirement-test relationships
5. Create TestStepVisualizer for test step visualization
6. Implement ParameterSelector with variant support
7. Create CommandTemplateEditor for editing command templates
8. Implement DragDropList for reordering items

Technology recommendations:
- Ant Design components as base
- styled-components for custom styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Use D3.js or Recharts for visualizations
- Implement virtualized lists for performance
- Create compound components for complex UIs
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Implement keyboard accessibility

# Test Strategy:
Write component tests using React Testing Library. Test components with various props and states. Verify that components render correctly. Test component interactions. Verify accessibility compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the ConfidenceScore and CoverageVisualization components for data visualization needs
### Details:
Create the ConfidenceScore component using D3.js or Recharts to visualize match confidence with appropriate color coding and visual indicators. Implement the CoverageVisualization component for displaying requirement-test relationships with interactive elements. Both components should be responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance using React.memo where appropriate.

## 2. Develop Status and Progress Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ProgressIndicator and TestStepVisualizer components for tracking and displaying process status
### Details:
Implement the ProgressIndicator component for showing AI processing status with appropriate animations using Framer Motion. Create the TestStepVisualizer component for visualizing test steps with support for different states (passed, failed, pending). Both components should use Ant Design as a base with styled-components for custom styling and include keyboard accessibility features.

## 3. Build Advanced Data Table Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a DataTable component with advanced filtering, sorting, and virtualization capabilities
### Details:
Create a DataTable component extending Ant Design's Table with advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities. Implement virtualized rendering for handling large datasets efficiently. Add support for custom cell renderers, expandable rows, and column customization. Ensure the component is fully accessible and responsive across different screen sizes.

## 4. Implement Interactive Editing Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the ParameterSelector and CommandTemplateEditor components for user input and editing
### Details:
Create the ParameterSelector component with support for variant selection and parameter configuration. Implement the CommandTemplateEditor for editing command templates with syntax highlighting and validation. Both components should provide immediate feedback on user input and support keyboard shortcuts for common operations. Use compound component patterns for complex UIs.

## 5. Create Drag and Drop Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2, 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Implement the DragDropList component for reordering items with smooth animations
### Details:
Develop a DragDropList component using Framer Motion for smooth drag and drop animations. Support reordering of various item types with custom rendering. Implement touch support for mobile devices and keyboard accessibility for users without mouse input. Add visual feedback during drag operations and smooth transitions when items are reordered.
