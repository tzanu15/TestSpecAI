# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement CRUD Operations for Core Entities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all core entities using SQLAlchemy.
# Details:
1. Create base CRUD class with common operations
2. Implement Requirements CRUD operations
3. Implement TestSpecification CRUD operations
4. Implement Parameter and ParameterVariant CRUD operations
5. Implement GenericCommand CRUD operations
6. Implement Category CRUD operations for both parameters and commands
7. Add filtering, sorting, and pagination support
8. Implement transaction management for complex operations

Technology recommendations:
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async query API
- Use SQLAlchemy select() for queries
- Implement pagination using limit() and offset()
- Use SQLAlchemy's with_for_update() for locking when needed
- Leverage SQLAlchemy's session.begin() for transaction management

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all CRUD operations. Test filtering, sorting, and pagination. Verify transaction rollback on errors. Test concurrent operations to ensure data integrity.
