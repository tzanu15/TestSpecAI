# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop API Endpoints for Requirements Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints for requirements management as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create requirements router with proper path prefix
2. Implement GET /requirements endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Implement POST /requirements for creating new requirements
4. Implement GET /requirements/{id} for retrieving specific requirements
5. Implement PUT /requirements/{id} for updating requirements
6. Implement DELETE /requirements/{id} for deleting requirements
7. Implement GET /requirements/categories for requirement categories
8. Implement GET /requirements/search with advanced filtering
9. Add proper error handling and response codes

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI Router for endpoint organization
- FastAPI Depends for dependency injection
- Use Path, Query, and Body for parameter validation
- Implement proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
- Use FastAPI's HTTPException for error handling

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests using pytest and TestClient. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper error responses. Test pagination and filtering. Verify that endpoints adhere to RESTful principles.
