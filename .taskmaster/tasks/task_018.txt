# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement AI Results Dashboard UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the user interface for displaying and interacting with AI matching and generation results.
# Details:
1. Create MatchingResults component for displaying NLP matching results
2. Implement LLMGeneration component for test generation
3. Create AIProgress component for tracking AI processing status
4. Implement confidence score visualization
5. Create side-by-side comparison view for matching results
6. Implement accept/reject actions for AI suggestions
7. Create feedback mechanism for improving AI results
8. Implement result filtering and sorting

Technology recommendations:
- Ant Design Card for result display
- Ant Design Progress for confidence score visualization
- Implement polling for status updates
- Use Ant Design Collapse for detailed result viewing
- Implement diff visualization for test comparison
- Use Ant Design notification for process completion
- Implement optimistic updates for accept/reject actions
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations

# Test Strategy:
Test matching results display with various confidence scores. Verify that the generation interface works correctly. Test status tracking during AI processing. Verify that accept/reject actions work correctly. Test feedback submission.
