# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop API Endpoints for Generic Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints for generic command management as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create commands router with proper path prefix
2. Implement GET /commands endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Implement POST /commands for creating new commands
4. Implement GET /commands/{id} for retrieving specific commands
5. Implement PUT /commands/{id} for updating commands
6. Implement DELETE /commands/{id} for deleting commands
7. Implement GET /commands/categories for command categories
8. Implement POST /commands/categories for creating command categories
9. Implement PUT /commands/categories/{id} for updating command categories
10. Implement DELETE /commands/categories/{id} for deleting command categories
11. Implement GET /commands/search with advanced filtering

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI Router for endpoint organization
- Implement template validation for command templates
- Validate parameter references in command templates
- Use transaction management for operations affecting multiple tests
- Implement proper error handling for dependent resources

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests using pytest and TestClient. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper error responses. Test template validation. Verify that commands with invalid parameter references are rejected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Commands Router and Basic Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the FastAPI router for commands with proper path prefix and implement the basic CRUD endpoints for commands.
### Details:
1. Create a new router in routes directory with '/commands' prefix
2. Implement GET /commands endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Implement POST /commands for creating new commands
4. Implement GET /commands/{id} for retrieving specific commands
5. Add proper request and response models
6. Implement error handling for common scenarios

## 2. Implement Command Update and Delete Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Complete the CRUD operations by implementing the update and delete endpoints for commands.
### Details:
1. Implement PUT /commands/{id} for updating commands
2. Implement DELETE /commands/{id} for deleting commands
3. Add validation to prevent deletion of commands in use
4. Implement proper transaction management
5. Add comprehensive error handling for dependent resources

## 3. Implement Command Categories Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create endpoints for managing command categories to organize commands.
### Details:
1. Implement GET /commands/categories for listing command categories
2. Implement POST /commands/categories for creating command categories
3. Implement PUT /commands/categories/{id} for updating command categories

### Details:
1. Create validation service for command templates
2. Implement syntax checking for command templates
3. Validate parameter references in command templates
4. Add validation hooks to POST and PUT endpoints
5. Implement detailed error responses for validation failures

## 5. Implement Advanced Search and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Add advanced search capabilities for commands and complete API documentation.
### Details:
1. Implement GET /commands/search with advanced filtering options
2. Add full-text search capabilities
3. Implement filtering by category, parameters used, and other attributes
4. Complete OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
5. Add usage examples to API documentation
