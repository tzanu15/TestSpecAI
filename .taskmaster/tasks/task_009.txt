# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop API Endpoints for Generic Commands
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints for generic command management as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create commands router with proper path prefix
2. Implement GET /commands endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Implement POST /commands for creating new commands
4. Implement GET /commands/{id} for retrieving specific commands
5. Implement PUT /commands/{id} for updating commands
6. Implement DELETE /commands/{id} for deleting commands
7. Implement GET /commands/categories for command categories
8. Implement POST /commands/categories for creating command categories
9. Implement PUT /commands/categories/{id} for updating command categories
10. Implement DELETE /commands/categories/{id} for deleting command categories
11. Implement GET /commands/search with advanced filtering

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI Router for endpoint organization
- Implement template validation for command templates
- Validate parameter references in command templates
- Use transaction management for operations affecting multiple tests
- Implement proper error handling for dependent resources

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests using pytest and TestClient. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper error responses. Test template validation. Verify that commands with invalid parameter references are rejected.
