# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement API Integration Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop frontend services for communicating with the backend API.
# Details:
1. Configure Axios with base URL and interceptors
2. Implement requirements API service
3. Create test specifications API service
4. Implement parameters API service
5. Create commands API service
6. Implement AI services API integration
7. Create error handling and retry logic
8. Implement request caching for performance

Technology recommendations:
- Axios 1.4.0+ for API requests
- Use Axios interceptors for authentication and error handling
- Implement request/response logging for debugging
- Use localStorage or IndexedDB for request caching
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Create typed API responses using TypeScript interfaces
- Use AbortController for request cancellation
- Implement request batching for bulk operations

# Test Strategy:
Mock API responses for testing. Verify that API services correctly handle success and error cases. Test retry logic with simulated failures. Verify that caching works correctly. Test request cancellation.
