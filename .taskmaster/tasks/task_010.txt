# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Document Processing Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the document processing service for importing requirements from various document formats.
# Details:
1. Create document_parser.py service
2. Implement Word document parsing using python-docx
3. Implement PDF parsing using PyPDF2
4. Implement Excel parsing using openpyxl
5. Create unified parsing interface for all document types
6. Implement requirement extraction logic
7. Add automatic categorization of requirements
8. Implement validation of extracted requirements
9. Create API endpoint for document upload and processing

Technology recommendations:
- python-docx 0.8.11+ for Word document parsing
- PyPDF2 3.0.0+ for PDF parsing
- openpyxl 3.1.0+ for Excel parsing
- python-multipart for file upload handling
- Use FastAPI's UploadFile for file handling
- Implement background tasks for long-running parsing operations
- Consider using regex patterns for requirement extraction

# Test Strategy:
Create test documents in various formats. Test parsing of each format. Verify that requirements are correctly extracted and categorized. Test handling of malformed documents. Verify that the API endpoint correctly processes uploaded files.
