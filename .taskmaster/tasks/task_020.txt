# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement State Management with Zustand
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop state management stores using Zustand for various application features.
# Details:
1. Create requirementsStore for requirements state
2. Implement testSpecsStore for test specifications state
3. Create parametersStore for parameters and variants state
4. Implement commandsStore for generic commands state
5. Create middleware for persistence and logging
6. Implement selectors for derived state
7. Create actions for state mutations
8. Implement optimistic updates for better UX

Technology recommendations:
- Zustand 4.3.0+ for state management
- Use TypeScript for type-safe stores
- Implement middleware for side effects
- Use Zustand's persist middleware for state persistence
- Create selectors for efficient rendering
- Implement immer for immutable updates
- Use devtools middleware for debugging
- Create separate slices for complex state

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for store actions and selectors. Test state persistence. Verify that optimistic updates work correctly. Test store interactions with mock API services. Verify that derived state is calculated correctly.
