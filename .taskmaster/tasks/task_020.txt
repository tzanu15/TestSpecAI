# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement State Management with Zustand
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop state management stores using Zustand for various application features.
# Details:
1. Create requirementsStore for requirements state
2. Implement testSpecsStore for test specifications state
3. Create parametersStore for parameters and variants state
4. Implement commandsStore for generic commands state
5. Create middleware for persistence and logging
6. Implement selectors for derived state
7. Create actions for state mutations
8. Implement optimistic updates for better UX

Technology recommendations:
- Zustand 4.3.0+ for state management
- Use TypeScript for type-safe stores
- Implement middleware for side effects
- Use Zustand's persist middleware for state persistence
- Create selectors for efficient rendering
- Implement immer for immutable updates
- Use devtools middleware for debugging
- Create separate slices for complex state

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for store actions and selectors. Test state persistence. Verify that optimistic updates work correctly. Test store interactions with mock API services. Verify that derived state is calculated correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Type-Safe Store Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational TypeScript interfaces and base store structure for all Zustand stores
### Details:
Define TypeScript interfaces for all state slices (requirements, testSpecs, parameters, commands). Create a base store factory function that applies common middleware. Set up the project folder structure for stores. Configure TypeScript for strict type checking. Implement basic store initialization patterns.

## 2. Implement Core Data Stores [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop the requirementsStore, testSpecsStore, parametersStore, and commandsStore with their basic CRUD operations
### Details:
Implement the four core stores with proper TypeScript typing. Create state slices for each store. Implement basic CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) for each store. Add initial state definitions. Ensure proper immutability patterns using immer. Implement basic error handling for state mutations.

## 3. Implement Middleware and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Add middleware for persistence, logging, and debugging to all stores
### Details:
Implement persist middleware for local storage persistence. Add logging middleware to track state changes. Configure devtools middleware for Redux DevTools integration. Create custom middleware for application-specific needs. Implement middleware for handling async operations. Add configuration options for enabling/disabling middleware.

## 4. Create Selectors and Derived State [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Implement efficient selectors for derived state and memoized calculations
### Details:
Create selectors for commonly accessed state. Implement memoization for expensive calculations. Develop derived state functions that combine data from multiple stores. Create filtering and sorting selectors. Implement pagination selectors. Add type-safe selector factories.

## 5. Implement Optimistic Updates and Advanced Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Add optimistic updates for better UX and implement complex state mutation actions
### Details:
Implement optimistic update pattern for all API interactions. Create rollback mechanisms for failed operations. Develop complex actions that update multiple state slices. Add transaction-like state updates for operations that need to be atomic. Implement state history tracking for undo/redo functionality. Create action creators for common patterns.
