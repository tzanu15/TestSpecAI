# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Production Deployment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop configuration and scripts for deploying the application to production.
# Details:
1. Create Docker configuration for backend
2. Implement Docker configuration for frontend
3. Create docker-compose for local deployment
4. Implement Nginx configuration for reverse proxy
5. Create database backup and restore scripts
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline configuration
7. Create environment-specific configuration
8. Implement monitoring and alerting setup

Technology recommendations:
- Docker 24.0.0+ for containerization
- docker-compose for multi-container deployment
- Nginx 1.25.0+ for reverse proxy and static file serving
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for CI/CD
- Implement PostgreSQL backup with pg_dump
- Create systemd service files for process management
- Use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Test Docker builds for both frontend and backend. Verify that docker-compose deployment works correctly. Test Nginx configuration. Verify that database backup and restore scripts work correctly. Test CI/CD pipeline with sample changes.
