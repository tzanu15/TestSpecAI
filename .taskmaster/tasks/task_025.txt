# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Production Deployment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop configuration and scripts for deploying the application to production.
# Details:
1. Create Docker configuration for backend
2. Implement Docker configuration for frontend
3. Create docker-compose for local deployment
4. Implement Nginx configuration for reverse proxy
5. Create database backup and restore scripts
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline configuration
7. Create environment-specific configuration
8. Implement monitoring and alerting setup

Technology recommendations:
- Docker 24.0.0+ for containerization
- docker-compose for multi-container deployment
- Nginx 1.25.0+ for reverse proxy and static file serving
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for CI/CD
- Implement PostgreSQL backup with pg_dump
- Create systemd service files for process management
- Use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Test Docker builds for both frontend and backend. Verify that docker-compose deployment works correctly. Test Nginx configuration. Verify that database backup and restore scripts work correctly. Test CI/CD pipeline with sample changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Docker Containers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Docker configurations for both frontend and backend components of the application.
### Details:
Develop Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend services following best practices. Include multi-stage builds to optimize image size. Configure proper environment variables, expose necessary ports, and set up volume mounts. Ensure proper caching mechanisms for faster builds. Use Docker 24.0.0+ and implement health checks for container monitoring.

## 2. Implement Deployment Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create docker-compose configuration for local and production deployment with proper service dependencies.
### Details:
Develop docker-compose.yml for orchestrating all services including frontend, backend, database, and any auxiliary services. Configure proper networking between containers. Set up volume mounts for persistent data. Implement environment-specific configurations using .env files. Create separate profiles for development, staging, and production environments.

## 3. Configure Nginx and SSL [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Implement Nginx as a reverse proxy with proper SSL configuration using Let's Encrypt.
### Details:
Create Nginx configuration for routing requests to appropriate services. Set up SSL termination using Let's Encrypt certificates. Configure proper caching headers for static assets. Implement HTTP/2 for improved performance. Set up automatic certificate renewal. Configure proper logging and error handling. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.

## 4. Implement Database Backup and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create scripts for automated PostgreSQL database backup, verification, and restoration.
### Details:
Develop shell scripts for automated PostgreSQL backups using pg_dump. Implement backup rotation and retention policies. Create verification steps to ensure backup integrity. Develop restoration procedures for disaster recovery. Set up scheduled backups using cron jobs. Implement backup encryption for sensitive data. Create documentation for backup and restore procedures.

## 5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Implement CI/CD pipeline configuration and monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana.
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configuration for automated testing, building, and deployment. Implement staging deployment for verification before production. Set up Prometheus for metrics collection from all services. Configure Grafana dashboards for visualizing system performance. Implement alerting for critical system metrics. Create systemd service files for process management on the production server. Set up log aggregation and analysis.
