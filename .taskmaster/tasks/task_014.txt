# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Frontend Layout and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core layout and navigation components for the frontend application.
# Details:
1. Create Layout component with sidebar and header
2. Implement Sidebar component with navigation items
3. Create Header component with breadcrumbs and user context
4. Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
5. Set up routing with React Router
6. Create protected routes for authenticated users
7. Implement breadcrumb generation based on current route
8. Add loading indicators and transitions between routes

Technology recommendations:
- Ant Design Layout, Menu, and Breadcrumb components
- React Router 6.14.0+ for routing
- Use React Router's Outlet for nested routes
- Implement responsive breakpoints using CSS media queries
- Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- Implement lazy loading for route components
- Use React.Suspense for loading states

# Test Strategy:
Test layout rendering on different screen sizes. Verify that navigation works correctly. Test protected routes with and without authentication. Verify that breadcrumbs are generated correctly. Test loading indicators during navigation.
