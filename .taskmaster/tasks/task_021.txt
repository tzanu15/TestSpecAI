# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Custom React Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop custom React hooks for common functionality and data access patterns.
# Details:
1. Create useRequirements hook for requirements data access
2. Implement useTestSpecs hook for test specifications data access
3. Create useParameters hook for parameters data access
4. Implement useCommands hook for generic commands data access
5. Create useAPI hook for API access
6. Implement usePagination hook for pagination logic
7. Create useSearch hook for search functionality
8. Implement useForm hook for form handling

Technology recommendations:
- React 18.2.0+ hooks API
- Use TypeScript for type-safe hooks
- Implement SWR or React Query patterns for data fetching
- Create custom hook composition for complex logic
- Use React's useCallback and useMemo for optimization
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Create error handling patterns for hooks
- Use React's useReducer for complex state logic

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for custom hooks using React Testing Library. Test hooks with various input parameters. Verify that hooks correctly handle loading, error, and success states. Test hook composition.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Data Access Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create custom React hooks for accessing domain-specific data including requirements, test specifications, parameters, and commands.
### Details:
Develop four data access hooks: useRequirements, useTestSpecs, useParameters, and useCommands. Each hook should implement SWR or React Query patterns for data fetching, include proper TypeScript typing, handle loading/error states, and implement proper cleanup in useEffect. Ensure consistent API patterns across all hooks.

## 2. Create useAPI Foundation Hook [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement a foundational useAPI hook that will serve as the base for all API interactions in the application.
### Details:
Develop the useAPI hook with TypeScript generics for type-safe API calls. Implement request caching, automatic retries, error handling, and request cancellation. Ensure the hook works with the existing API structure and integrates with Zustand state management. Include authentication handling and request/response interceptors.

## 3. Implement UI Utility Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Create usePagination, useSearch, and useForm hooks for common UI patterns and interactions.
### Details:
Develop three UI utility hooks: usePagination for handling paginated data with configurable page sizes, useSearch for implementing search functionality with debouncing, and useForm for form state management with validation. Ensure all hooks are optimized using useCallback and useMemo where appropriate.

## 4. Create Hook Composition Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Develop patterns for composing multiple hooks together to handle complex application logic.
### Details:
Create composition patterns that combine multiple hooks for complex scenarios. Implement useRequirementsWithSearch that combines useRequirements and useSearch, usePaginatedAPI that combines useAPI and usePagination, and useFormWithValidation that extends useForm with advanced validation. Document these patterns for team reference.

## 5. Optimize and Document Custom Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Optimize all custom hooks for performance and create comprehensive documentation.
### Details:
Review and optimize all hooks using React's useCallback and useMemo. Implement useReducer for hooks with complex state logic. Create error boundaries and standardized error handling patterns. Document each hook with JSDoc comments, usage examples, and edge case handling. Create a hooks documentation page in Storybook.
