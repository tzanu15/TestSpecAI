# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop API Endpoints for Test Specifications
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints for test specification management as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create test-specs router with proper path prefix
2. Implement GET /test-specs endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Implement POST /test-specs for creating new test specifications
4. Implement GET /test-specs/{id} for retrieving specific test specifications
5. Implement PUT /test-specs/{id} for updating test specifications
6. Implement DELETE /test-specs/{id} for deleting test specifications
7. Implement GET /test-specs/{id}/steps for retrieving test steps
8. Implement POST /test-specs/{id}/steps for adding test steps
9. Implement PUT /test-specs/{id}/steps/{step_id} for updating test steps
10. Implement DELETE /test-specs/{id}/steps/{step_id} for deleting test steps

Technology recommendations:
- FastAPI Router for endpoint organization
- Use nested routes for test steps management
- Implement proper validation for step sequence numbers
- Use transaction management for multi-step operations
- Implement proper error handling for dependent resources

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests using pytest and TestClient. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper error responses. Test the relationship between test specifications and steps. Verify that step sequence is maintained correctly.
