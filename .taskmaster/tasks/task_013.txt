Technology recommendations:
- React 18.2.0+
- TypeScript 5.0.0+
- Vite 4.4.0+ for fast development and building
- Ant Design Pro 4.0.0+ for UI components
- styled-components 6.0.0+ for styling
- React Router 6.14.0+ for routing
- Zustand 4.3.0+ for state management
- Axios 1.4.0+ for API requests
- Vitest 0.33.0+ and React Testing Library 14.0.0+ for testing
- ESLint 8.44.0+ and Prettier 3.0.0+ for code quality

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development environment can be set up with a single command. Test that all configured tools work together. Verify that the build process produces optimized output. Test that the testing environment works correctly.
